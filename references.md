We went ahead and added a new file called references.md and pushed that change to main, without updating your my-resume branch.

Browse to the my-resume branch.
Click the Add file dropdown menu and then on Create new file.
Create a file named references.md.
Enter some text that conflicts with what we added for references.md in the main branch.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter a commit message for your change.
Click the Commit new file button, making sure the "Commit directly to the my-resume branch" option is selected.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
